The createEmptyVault function is a simple utility within the ExampleToken contract that creates and returns a new instance of the Vault resource. This new Vault is initialized with a balance of 0.0 tokens, meaning it starts empty. The function uses the create Vault(balance: 0.0) syntax to create this new Vault resource. The resulting Vault is then returned as a reference (@Vault), which can be used to store and manage tokens later. This function is typically used when setting up a new account or when a fresh vault is needed to hold tokens, ensuring that the vault starts with no tokens in it.
